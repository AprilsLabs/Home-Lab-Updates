# Home-Lab-Updates

Hello Everyone!

This is a place/repo almost like a blog where I post updates done to my home lab setup. Will only post for major Updates but will add any smaller updated done in between.

As far as files i will post cool things i have created along with anything that was used in my homelab IE: Dockers, File Settings, Programs, Hardware Lists and possible graphical pictures in the future.
